# Module 17 Challenge: Credit Risk Analysis

## Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate different supervised machine learning models to see which one is the best in predicting credit risk from loan applications. For this analysis, I will be using Python and the Scikit-Learn library to create machine learning models and task them with assessing credit risk data.

## Results:

### Naive Random Oversampling:
#### Balanced Accuracy Score:
![Credit_Risk](https://github.com/mbroad1/Module-17-Credit-Risk-Analysis/blob/main/random_oversampling_balanced_accuracy_score.png)
- The balanced accuracy score of this model was about **0.65** meaning 65% of the predicted credit risk outputs were predicted correctly.

#### Precision and Recall:
